## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first front-end mentor challenge. 
It's my first time to use flexbox without relying on frameworks. I tried the mobile first approach for the responsive. 
Overall, I've enjoyed working on this and more challenge to solve soon!

### Continued development

Try CSS grid instead of flexbox.
Use HTML5 Semantic Elements - practice code with accessibility.

### My next goals ..

I want to practice and improve more on using flexbox and later, CSS grid. 
I also want improve also my personal judgement on sizes, spacings, margins, etc.
